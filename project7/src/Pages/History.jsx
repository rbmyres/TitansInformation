        <h1>History</h1>

        <p>In 1959, K.S. “Bud” Adams Jr. founded the Houston Oilers as one of the eight members of the upstart American Football League. Led by Hall of Fame quarterback George Blanda, the Oilers made three straight AFL championship appearances, winning in both 1960 and 1961.         </p>
  
        <p>Then, in 1970, the AFL merged with the NFL where the Oilers joined the AFC’s Central Division. The Oilers failed to make the playoffs until 1978 when the Titans drafted Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell with the first overall pick. In each season from 1978-1980, Earl Campbell led the NFL in rushing yards, won Offensive Player of the Year, and took the Oilers to three playoff berths and two AFC championship appearances.        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Earl Campbell would face injuries which derailed his career. The Oilers faced a playoff drought from 1981-1987 until Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon had a breakout season. Warren Moon, joined by Hall of Fame offensive lineman Mike Munchak and Bruce Matthews, led the Oilers to six consecutive playoff appearances from 1987 to 1993; however, after the 1993 season, Moon was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, Munchak retired, and many disappointing seasons followed.         </p>
    
        <p>After the 1995 season, the Houston Oilers moved to Tennessee and became known as the Tennessee Oilers. From 1996-1998, the Tennessee Oilers had some of the worst crowd attendance in NFL history, so owner Bud Adams decided to rename the team to the Tennessee Titans along with the opening of the new stadium in Nashville, Tennessee.         </p>

        <p>In 1999, the new Tennessee Titans, led by MVP quarterback Steve McNair and Hall of Fame running back Eddie George, made one of the most dramatic playoff appearances in NFL history. After reaching the AFC Wild Card game, the Titans were down 16-15 with 16 seconds left to play. On the final kickoff, tight end Frank Wycheck threw a lateral across the field to wide receiver Kevin Dyson who took the lateral 75 yards for a game winning touchdown. This legendary win was coined the “Music City Miracle”. The Titans then went on to reach the Super Bowl where they were down 23-16 with one drive left. The Titans quickly drove down the field from their own 12 yard line. As time expired, wide receiver Kevin Dyson was tackled one yard shy of the end zone, and the Titans suffered a heartbreaking loss. This play was then coined “The Longest Yard”.         </p>

        <p>After this stunning loss, the Titans suffered from mixed success until 2018 when the Titans hired head coach Mike Vrabel. Mike Vrabel, joined by All Pro players Jeffery Simmons, A.J. Brown, and Derrick Henry, led the titans to the best record in the AFC, three straight playoff appearances, and an AFC championship game appearance.         </p>

        <p>After these playoff seasons, the Titans faced back-to-back losing seasons in 2022 and 2023. Due to inner-turmoil between Vrabel, Carthon, and Adams, Vrabel was fired, and a new area of Titans football was ushered in.         </p>
